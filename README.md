# app-Sample
app  sample for tutorial use of github

I am trying to get my head around the gitHub concept.  I usuall work alone but have found with IT and coding, 
it is better to work in a team, and teams use the hub.  Trying to understand the commit, add, push concepts.  
I wouldn't follow to closly, this train may be off the rails A LOT! 

Thanks

Jason
